Basic random data generator implementation
It takes json configuration file as input and provides multithreaded data generation.
Please take a look to comments of config/config.go to see all possible configuration values.
Currently data is generated with separate goroutine per column.
It can be improved with multiples goroutines per column, but then it will be more complicated to support taxonomy.
